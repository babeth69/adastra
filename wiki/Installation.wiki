  * uninstall any previous Adastra deployment
  * download and install Adastra
  * install OpenVibe 0.11 or later (usually in c:\Program Files\openvibe)
  * check [EmotivEPOCH Emotiv EPOC] if you are using this device

= Additional notes =
OpenVibe is started by Adastra, you do not need to start it in advance. Adastra modifies one of the OpenVibe's bat files in order to resolve a bug with parameters forwarding in OpenVibe 10.1. Currently Adastra runs only on Windows. Running Adastra under [http://www.mono-project.com Mono] is currently unsupported. See [MonoPorting Mono porting] page.
