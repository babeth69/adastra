Idea:

Using the time-frequency domain technique empirical mode decomposition (EMD) in combination of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to perform model reduction and extract hidden features.

Then the above computational result is forward to a multi-class classifier such as: ANN or SVM(there are such).
