When doing Digital Signal Processing and Machine Learning you can choose a operation workflow and tune each one of the elements of the workflow.

A "box" in OpenVibe scenario is a single element in workflow which is actually called a "scenario". You can open an OpenVibe scenario in Adastra and tune each one of the following boxes:

  * You can use a Surface Laplacian to focus the signal around specific channels. The idea is not to discard the data from the rest of the channels, but rather give more weight to these specific channels than the others.
