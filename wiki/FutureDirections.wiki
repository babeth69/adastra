===Short-term plans===

  * implement additional machine learning algorithms
  * add feature vector generation to Adastra (as a replacement for the one provided by OpenVibe)
  * use Encog Artificial Intelligence Framework for DotNet

===Long-term plans===

  * classification of a whole EEG record of length 3-15 minutes. This will be used to discover famous neuro-degenerative diseases. 
    * using of non-negative matrix factorization
  * using WPF to display and annotate events in the signal
