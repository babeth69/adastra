===Short-term plans===
  * add support for [EmotivEPOCH Emotiv EPOCH] without using OpenVibe (in progress)
  * add support for WPF signal charting (in progress)
  * add parallel computing for machine learning algorithms thanks to Microsoft Task Parallel Library or Microsoft [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/accelerator Accelerator]
  * implement additional machine learning algorithms
  * add feature vector generation to Adastra (as a replacement for the one provided by OpenVibe)
  * use [http://www.heatonresearch.com/encog Encog Artificial Intelligence Framework] for DotNet
  * evaluate [http://machine.codeplex.com Machine Learning for .NET]

===Long-term plans===

  * classification of a whole EEG record of length 3-15 minutes. This will be used to discover famous [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration neurodegenerative diseases] such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%E2%80%99s Alzheimer]. Tests about Alzheimer diseases are often not conclusive enough. 
    * using non-negative matrix factorization
  * using WPF to display and annotate events in the signal
    * e.x. annotate EEG spikes as an eye-blink or rapid eye movement, etc
