===Short-term plans===
  * add support for [EmotivEPOCH Emotiv EPOCH] without using OpenVibe
  * add support for WPF signal charting
  * add parallel computing of the ML model
  * implement additional machine learning algorithms
  * add feature vector generation to Adastra (as a replacement for the one provided by OpenVibe)
  * use Encog Artificial Intelligence Framework for DotNet

===Long-term plans===

  * classification of a whole EEG record of length 3-15 minutes. This will be used to discover famous [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration neurodegenerative diseases] such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%E2%80%99s Alzheimer]. Tests about Alzheimer diseases are often not conclusive enough. 
    * using non-negative matrix factorization
  * using WPF to display and annotate events in the signal
    * e.x. annotate that current spikes on the EEG chart were an eye-blink or rapid eye movement, etc
