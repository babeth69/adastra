= Introduction =

Octave is a free clone of Matlab. Adastra has an Octave C# .NET wrapper that can executes any Octave/Matlab script and returns the result to C# for further processing. 


= Details =

Using Octave in Adastra has the following advantages:
 
 * reuse existing Matlab/Octave code 
 * Octave/Matlab provide sophisticated math functions that might not be available in Math libraries implemented for .NET
 * cross OS software development. Adastra runs only on Windows, but Octave runs almost on any Windows, Unix OS.
