= Introduction =

Adastra is developed in C# and the UI is multi-threaded. Adastra can be compiled with the free [http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/visual-csharp-express Visual C# 2010 Express] edition of Visual Studio. One of the primary goals of this project is to be easy to develop. Simply installing VS 2010 should be enough to compile and run it. Target .NET Frameworks is 4.0.

= Libraries =

The following software libraries are used in Adastra:

  * AForge.NET
  * Accord.NET
  * Vrpn.NET contains unmanaged code

All libraries are provided with Adastra's downloads.

= Extending Adastra =

  * Implement IRawDataReader - acquires raw data. For example the EmotivRawDataReader is used as a link between Adastra and Emotiv driver.

  * IFeatureGenerator - classes that inherit this interface provide feature vectors used by machine learning algorithms. One FeatureGenerator is responsible for all previous steps such as: acquiring signal, time slicing, signal filtering and calculation of the feature vectors themselves. For example the OpenVibeFeatureGenerator does all this job by connecting to OpenVibe.   

= Additional Notes =

.NET class OpenVibeController contains calls to several Windows API unmanaged functions. Running under Linux might be possible. See [MonoPorting Mono porting]
