Core algorithms in Adastra are pure C# and they will run on [http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page Mono] without modification.

Adastra can use [http://www.mono-project.com/GtkSharp GTK Sharp] for UI. 

When porting to [http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page Mono] the following components will need special care:

  * VRPN.net contains unmanaged code and it will need rewriting in pure managed code
  * Windows Forms signal charting should be disabled or replaced with another control
  * OpenVibeController should be ported (should not be a problem)
  * WPF is unsupported by Mono
